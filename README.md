A tool developed by Minghui Li Group and maintained by ZeFeng Zhu.

* ðŸ”¨ stands for __\[under construction]__

`Muta3DMaps` is Python Package that retrieves, filtering and organizes data from various databases or tools via API to process the residue-level mapping between protein sequences and protein 3D structures.

## Dependent Tool & DB
* SIFTS
* UniProt
* wwPDB
* Interactome3D
* SWISS-MODEL Repository ðŸ”¨
* ModBase ðŸ”¨




## Function
* Collect data from SIFTS, UniProt, wwPDB(MMCIF), Interactome3D, SMR, ModBase
* Define representative structures(PDB or Model) of a uniprot(Canonical) with a score-based approach ðŸ”¨
* Map mutation from (transcript/UniProt) isoform to (Canonical UniProt/PDB/Model) or from PDB  to UniProt Isoform.

## Regarded as Modules
> Correspondence Between Core Functions and ```PYTHON``` Files

* ```ProcessUniProt.py```
  * UniProt ID Mapping API
* ```ProcessSIFTS.py```
  * Map PDB to UniProt and vice versa
  * Map PDB Mutation Site to UniProt and vice versa
* ```RetrievePDB.py```
  * Download PDB Files
